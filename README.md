Hello,

I would like to say thank you for the opportunity that you have provided me to do this coding challange.

Unfortunately I was not able to complete the task However I have used CSS and HTML for it as I could not get SCSS to work.

I would also like to point out that took me around an hour to download yarn and find the media and was working on the Desktop version.

Thank you for your time.
